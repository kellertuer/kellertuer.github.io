# About

@def title = "About."

\floatleftimg{/assets/ronnybergmann.jpg}{R. Bergmann}
I am a postdoctoral researcher and Deputy Head of the
{{institute NumaPDE}} lead by {{person RolandHerzog}}
since April 2018. Previously I worked within the {{institute imagepro short}}
at {{institute TUK}}
led by {{person GabrieleSteidl}}, where I wrote my habilitation.
Prior to that I was a doctoral researcher with teaching obligations
at the {{institute IfM}} at the {{institute UzL}}
working together with my [PhD](/publications/index.html) supervisor {{person J端rgenPrestin}}.

My [Erd&#337;s number](https://oakland.edu/enp/) is 3, by courtesy of {{person J端rgenPrestin}}.

Currently I am working on
* graph based methods for manifold-valued image and data processing combining both local and nonlocal methods.
* optimization on manifolds, especially proximal methods and their application in manifold-valued image processing
* implementing optimization methods on manifolds and high-dimensional power manifolds as they appear in the previous two topics in open source software packages, see my [projects](projects/index.html)
* anisotropic periodic translation invariant spaces and Fourier based algorithms applied to Homogenization

### Miscelanea
A short list of pages, where you can find me, too
* Within the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=180383)
* at the [Zentralblatt Mathematik](https://zbmath.org/authors/?s=0&q=Bergmann%2C+Ronny).

Research has the advantage that you get around! It brought me to
