I am a postdoctoral researcher and deputy head of the
{{institute NumaPDE}}, {{institute TUC}}, lead by {{person "Roland Herzog"}}, which I joined in April 2018. Previously I worked within the {{institute imagepro short}},
{{institute TUK}},
led by {{person "Gabriele Steidl"}}, where I finished my [habilitation](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2018) beginning of 2018.
Prior to that I was a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant
at the {{institute IfM}}, {{institute UzL}},
working together with my [PhD](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2013-1) supervisor {{person "JÃ¼rgen Prestin"}}.

Currently I am working on
* nonsmooth optimization on manifolds, especially proximal methods and their application in manifold-valued image processing
* optimization methods on manifolds and high-dimensional power manifolds
* graph based methods for manifold-valued image and data processing combining both local and nonlocal methods.
* anisotropic periodic translation invariant spaces and Fourier based algorithms
