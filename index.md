I am a postdoctoral researcher and Deputy Head of the
{{institute NumaPDE}} lead by {{person "Roland Herzog"}}
since April 2018. Previously I worked within the {{institute imagepro short}}
at {{institute TUK}}
led by {{person "Gabriele Steidl"}}, where I finished my [habilitation](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2018) beginning of 2018.
Prior to that I was a doctoral researcher with teaching obligations
at the {{institute IfM}} at the {{institute UzL}}
working together with my [PhD](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2013-1) supervisor {{person "Jürgen Prestin"}}.

My [Erd&#337;s number](https://oakland.edu/enp/) is 3, by courtesy of {{person "Jürgen Prestin"}}.

Currently I am working on
* graph based methods for manifold-valued image and data processing combining both local and nonlocal methods.
* optimization on manifolds, especially proximal methods and their application in manifold-valued image processing
* implementing optimization methods on manifolds and high-dimensional power manifolds as they appear in the previous two topics in open source software packages, see my [projects](projects/index.html)
* anisotropic periodic translation invariant spaces and Fourier based algorithms applied to Homogenization
