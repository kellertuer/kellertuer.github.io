I am Associate Professor ([Førsteamanuensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_Norway#Associate_professor)) at the {{Institute IMF}}, {{Institute NTNU}} (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, since March 2021.
I was a postdoctoral researcher and deputy head of the
{{institute NumaPDE}} {{institute TUC}}, led by {{person "Roland Herzog"}}, which I joined in April 2018 (since April 2021: {{institute scoop short}}@IWR Heidelberg).
Previously I worked within the {{institute imagepro short}},
{{institute TUK}}, led by {{person "Gabriele Steidl"}} (since 2020: {{institute FGAW short}}@TU Berlin),
where I finished my [habilitation](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2018) beginning of 2018.
Prior to that I was a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant
at the {{institute IfM}}, {{institute UzL}},
working together with my [PhD](/publications/index.html#Bergmann-2013-1) supervisor {{person "Jürgen Prestin"}}.

Currently I am working on
* nonsmooth optimization on manifolds, especially proximal methods and their application in manifold-valued image processing
* optimization methods on manifolds and high-dimensional power manifolds
* graph based methods for manifold-valued image and data processing combining both local and nonlocal methods.
* anisotropic periodic translation invariant spaces and Fourier based algorithms
