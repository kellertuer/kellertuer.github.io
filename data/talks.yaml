    In many scientific and engineering scenarios, measured data or model variables lie in
    smooth, nonlinear spaces like the sphere or the group of 3D rotations. Such spaces often
    have a manifold structure, that is, they locally can be approximately linearized
    (i.e. they are locally diffeomorphic to a Hilbert space). Equipping such manifolds with
    a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric tensor, which defines a ruler on the manifold, enables
    local computation of distances and angles. These features enable construction of
    efficient algorithms that respect the nonlinear structure, for example for optimization,
    interpolation, and statistical modeling.

    In this talk, we demonstrate various tools that [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) provides for working with
    manifolds. With these tools, you can for example explicitly locally linearize points
    using inverse retractions and orthonormal bases. You can also compute intrinsic
    statistics, such as the Riemannian mean and variance, of data on manifolds. We also
    extend [Distributions.jl](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/) to support distributions on arbitrary manifolds, which can be
    used to generate random points on a manifold or for statistical modeling.

    [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) implements a library of manifolds and provides combinators to construct new
    manifolds from these. Examples are the product manifold of two manifolds, the power
    manifold, the tangent bundle, and Lie groups. Using a trait-based system, any manifold
    may be augmented with additional geometric structure, including various metrics, without
    sacrificing efficiency.

    We also present the light-weight interface package [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html), which enables users
    to easily extend [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) with new algorithms and additional manifolds thanks to
    multiple dispatch. The interface can also be used to develop new, stand-alone projects.
    It is minimally restrictive and makes it possible to write algorithms that are
    independent from any concrete implementations of the manifolds. One package that uses
    this interface is [Manopt.jl](https://manoptjl.org), which provides optimization algorithms on Riemannian
    manifolds, with a focus on high-dimensional and non-smooth optimization.

    Fitting a smooth curve to a set of n data points lying on a Riemannian manifold
    and associated with real-valued time points is a common problem in applications
    like wind field approximation, rigid body motion interpolation, or sphere-valued
    data analysis. The resulting curve should strike a balance between data
    proximity and a smoothing regularization constraint.

    In this talk we present a variational model to fit a composite Bézier curve
    to the set of data points on a Riemannian manifold. The resulting curve is
    obtained in such a way that its mean squared acceleration is minimal in addition
    to remaining close the data points. We approximate the acceleration by
    discretizing the squared second order derivative along the curve. We derive a
    closed-form, numerically stable and efficient algorithm to compute the gradient
    of a Bézier curve on manifolds with respect to its control points. This gradient
    can be expressed as a concatenation of so called adjoint Jacobi fields.

            Due to recent technological advances in the development of modern
            sensors new imaging modalities have emerged for which the acquired

            values in InSAR imaging or when dealing with diffusion tensors in
            DT-MRI. Furthermore, to process not only rectangular domains and
            regular grids, graphs can be employed to model both data on
            arbitrary (sampled) manifolds as well as nonlocal vicinity.

      Recently, there has been a strong ambition to translate models and algorithms
      from traditional image processing to non-Euclidean domains, e.g., to
      manifold-valued data. While the task of denoising has been extensively
      studied in the last years, there was rarely an attempt to perform image
      inpainting on manifold-valued data. In this paper we present a nonlocal
      inpainting method for manifold-valued data given on a finite weighted graph.
      We introduce a new graph infinity-Laplace operator based on the idea of
      discrete minimizing Lipschitz extensions, which we use to formulate the
      inpainting problem as PDE on the graph. Furthermore, we derive an explicit
      numerical solving scheme, which we evaluate on two classes of synthetic
      manifold-valued images.

    In many real life application measured data takes its values on
    Riemannian manifolds. For the special case of the Euclidean space this setting
    includes the classical grayscale and color images.
    Like these classical images, manifold-valued data might suffer from
    measurement errors in form of noise or missing data. In this talk we
    present the manifold-valued image restoration toolbox (MVIRT)
    that provides implementations of classical image processing tasks. Based on
    recent developments in variational methods for manifold-valued image
    processing methods, like total variation regularization, the toolbox
    provides easy access to work with these algorithms.
    The toolbox is implemented in Matlab, open source, and easily extendible,
    e.g. with own manifolds, noise models or further algorithms.
    This paper introduces the main mathematical methods as well as numerical
    examples.

    In many real-world applications measured data are not in a Euclidean vector space but rather are given on a Riemannian manifold. This is the case, e.g., when dealing with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data consisting of phase values or data obtained in Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI).

    In this talk we present a framework for processing discrete manifold-valued data, for which the underlying (sampling) topology is modeled by a graph. We introduce the notion of a manifold-valued differences on a graph and based on this deduce a family of manifold-valued graph operators. In particular, we introduce the graph p-Laplacian and graph infinity-Laplacian for manifold-valued data. We discuss a numerical scheme to compute a solution to the corresponding parabolic PDEs and apply this algorithm to different manifold-valued data, illustrating the diversity and flexibility of the proposed framework in denoising and inpainting applications.

    In many real world situations, measured data is noisy and nonlinear, i.e., the data is given as values in a certain manifold or on a submanifold of the euclidean space the measurements are taken in. Examples are InSAR images and the hue channel of HSV, where the entries are phase-valued, directions in $\mathbb R n$, which are data given on sphere $\mathbb S^{n−1}$, and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, where the obtained data items are symmetric positive definite $3\times 3$ matrices.

    In this talk we extend the recently introduced total variation model on manifolds by a second order TV type model. We first introduce second order differences on manifolds in a sound way using the induced metric on Riemannian manifolds. By avoiding a definition involving tangent bundles, this definition allows for a minimization employing the inexact cyclic proximal point algorithm, where the proximal maps can be computed using Jacobian fields. The algorithm is then applied to several examples on the aforementioned manifolds to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.

    Cyclic data arise in various image and signal processing applications such
    as interferometric synthetic aperture radar, electroencephalogram data
    analysis, and color image restoration in HSV or LCh spaces.
    In this paper we introduce a variational inpainting model for cyclic data
    which utilizes our definition of absolute cyclic second order differences.
    Based on analytical expressions for the proximal mappings of these
    differences we propose a cyclic proximal point algorithm (CPPA) for
    minimizing the corresponding functional.
    We choose appropriate cycles to implement this algorithm in an efficient
    way. We further introduce a simple strategy to initialize the unknown
    inpainting region. Numerical results both for synthetic and real-world data
    demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.

    Für periodische Wavelets im eindimensionalen Fall ist seit Mitte der 1990er
    Jahre eine umfassende Theorie bekannt. Dieser Vortrag stellt die
    multivariate Verallgemeinerung vor. Ausgehend von anisotropen gleichmäßigen
    Mustern auf dem $d$-dimensionalen Torus wird eine diskrete
    Fourier-Transformation definiert. Dies führt zu diskreten Frequenzmengen
    – die erzeugende Gruppe –, die bestimmte Richtungen bevorzugen und trotzdem
    schnelle Algorithmen ermöglichen. Dazu ist es notwendig, eine bestimmte
    Anordnung der Musterpunkte, sowie der erzeugenden Gruppe, zu finden.
    Die darauf aufbauende Wavelet-Zerlegung wird für den Spezialfall einer
    dyadischen Zerlegung präsentiert. Sie zerlegt einen Raum von Translaten
    in zwei zueinander orthogonale Unterräume mit jeweils halber Dimension des
    Ursprungsraumes. Auch hier ist eine schnelle Implementierung möglich, wenn
    man für die Elemente der erzeugenden Gruppe eine entsprechende Anordnung
    wählt.
