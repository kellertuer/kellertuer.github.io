A major class of examples are triangulated surfaces as they occur for instance in finite element computations. The analysis of the functional is based on a differential geometric setting in which the unit normal vector is viewed as an element of the two-dimensional sphere manifold. It is found to agree with the discrete total mean curvature known in discrete differential geometry. A split Bregman iteration is proposed for the solution of discretized shape optimization problems, in which the total variation of the normal appears as a regularizer.

    We are interested in restoring images having values in a symmetric Hadamard
    manifold by minimizing a functional with a quadratic data term and a total
    variation like regularizing term.
    To solve the convex minimization problem, we extend the Douglas-Rachford
    algorithm and its parallel version to symmetric Hadamard manifolds.
    The core of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm are reflections of the functions
    involved in the functional to be minimized.
    In the Euclidean setting the reflections of convex lower semicontinuous
    functions are nonexpansive.
    As a consequence, convergence results for Krasnoselski-Mann iterations
    imply the convergence of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm.
    Unfortunately, this general results does not carry over to Hadamard manifolds,
    where proper convex lower semicontinuous functions can have expansive
    reflections.
    However, splitting our restoration functional in an appropriate way, we have
    only to deal with special functions namely, several distance-like functions
    and an indicator functions of a special convex sets.
    We prove that the reflections of certain distance-like functions on Hadamard
    manifolds are nonexpansive which is an interesting result on its own.
    Furthermore, the reflection of the involved indicator function is nonexpansive
    on Hadamard manifolds with constant curvature so that the Douglas-Rachford
    algorithm converges here.

  interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electroencephalogram (EEG)
  data analysis, ground-based astronomy, and color image restoration, in HSV or
  LCh spaces the data has its range on the one-dimensional sphere \(\mathbb S^1\).
  Although the minimization of total variation (TV) regularized functionals is
  among the most popular methods for edge-preserving image restoration,
  such methods were only very recently applied to cyclic structures.
  However, as for Euclidean data, TV regularized variational methods suffer
  from the so-called staircasing effect. This effect can be avoided by involving
  higher order derivatives into the functional.
  This is the first paper which uses higher order differences of cyclic data in
  regularization terms of energy functionals for image restoration.
  We introduce absolute higher order differences for \(\mathbb S^1\)-valued
  data in a sound way which is independent of the chosen representation system
  on the circle. Our absolute cyclic first order difference is just the
  geodesic distance between points. Similar to the geodesic distances, the
  absolute cyclic second order differences have only values in \([0,\pi]\).
  We update the cyclic variational TV approach by our new cyclic second order
  differences.
  To minimize the corresponding functional we apply a cyclic proximal
  point method which was recently successfully proposed for Hadamard manifolds.
  Choosing appropriate cycles this algorithm can be implemented in an efficient
  way. The main steps require the evaluation of proximal mappings of our cyclic
  differences for which we provide analytical expressions. Under certain
  conditions we prove the convergence of our algorithm. Various numerical
  examples with artificial as well as real-world data demonstrate
  the advantageous performance of our algorithm.},
