        We introduce a new non-smooth variational model for the restoration of manifold-valued data which includes second order differences in the regularization term.
        While such models were successfully applied for real-valued images, we introduce the second order difference and the corresponding variational models for manifold data, which up to now only existed for cyclic data.
        The approach requires a combination of techniques from numerical analysis, convex optimization and differential geometry.
        First, we establish a suitable definition of absolute second order differences for signals and images with values in a manifold.
        Employing this definition, we introduce a variational denoising model based on first and second order differences in the manifold setup.
        In order to minimize the corresponding functional, we develop an algorithm using an inexact cyclic proximal point algorithm.
        We propose an efficient strategy for the computation of the corresponding proximal mappings in symmetric spaces utilizing the machinery of Jacobi fields. For the $n$-sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practice.
        We prove the convergence of the proposed exact and inexact variant of the cyclic proximal point algorithm in Hadamard spaces.
        These results which are of interest on its own include, e.g., the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices.

        An analogue of the total variation prior for the normal vector field along the boundary of piecewise flat shapes in 3D is introduced.
        A major class of examples are triangulated surfaces as they occur for instance in finite element computations.
        The analysis of the functional is based on a differential geometric setting in which the unit normal vector is viewed as an element of the two-dimensional sphere manifold.
        It is found to agree with the discrete total mean curvature known in discrete differential geometry.
        A split Bregman iteration is proposed for the solution of discretized shape optimization problems, in which the total variation of the normal appears as a regularizer.
        Unlike most other priors, such as surface area, the new functional allows for piecewise flat shapes.
        As two applications, a mesh denoising and a geometric inverse problem of inclusion detection type involving a partial differential equation are considered.
        Numerical experiments confirm that polyhedral shapes can be identified quite accurately.
