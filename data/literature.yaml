        In this paper, we introduce a definition of Fenchel conjugate and Fenchel biconjugate on Hadamard manifolds based on the tangent bundle.
        Our definition overcomes the inconvenience that the conjugate depends on the choice of a certain point on the manifold, as previous definitions required.
        On the other hand, this new definition still possesses properties known to hold in the Euclidean case.
        The tangent bundle approach even yields a broader interpretation of the Fenchel conjugate in the Euclidean case itself.
        Most prominently, our definition of the Fenchel conjugate provides a Fenchel-Moreau Theorem for geodesically convex, proper, lower semicontinuous functions.
        In addition, this framework allows us to develop a theory of separation of convex sets on Hadamard manifolds, and we obtain a strict separation theorem.

        An analogue of the total variation prior for the normal vector field along the boundary of piecewise flat shapes in 3D is introduced.
        A major class of examples are triangulated surfaces as they occur for instance in finite element computations.
        The analysis of the functional is based on a differential geometric setting in which the unit normal vector is viewed as an element of the two-dimensional sphere manifold.
        It is found to agree with the discrete total mean curvature known in discrete differential geometry.
        A split Bregman iteration is proposed for the solution of discretized shape optimization problems, in which the total variation of the normal appears as a regularizer.
        Unlike most other priors, such as surface area, the new functional allows for piecewise flat shapes.
        As two applications, a mesh denoising and a geometric inverse problem of inclusion detection type involving a partial differential equation are considered.
        Numerical experiments confirm that polyhedral shapes can be identified quite accurately.

        An analogue of the total variation prior for the normal vector field along the boundary of smooth shapes in 3D is introduced.
        The analysis of the total variation of the normal vector field is based on a differential geometric setting in which the unit normal vector is viewed as an element of the two-dimensional sphere manifold.
        It is shown that spheres are stationary points when the total variation of the normal is minimized under an area constraint.
        Shape calculus is used to characterize the relevant derivatives.
        Since the total variation functional is non-differentiable whenever the boundary contains flat regions, an extension of the split Bregman method to manifold valued functions is proposed.

        Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for equality and inequality constrained optimization problems on smooth manifolds are formulated.
        Under the Guignard constraint qualification, local minimizers are shown to admit Lagrange multipliers.
        The linear independence, Mangasarian-Fromovitz, and Abadie constraint qualifications are also formulated, and the chain “LICQ implies MFCQ implies ACQ implies GCQ” is proved.
        Moreover, classical connections between these constraint qualifications and the set of Lagrange multipliers are established, which parallel the results in Euclidean space.
        The constrained Riemannian center of mass on the sphere serves as an illustrating numerical example.},

        We introduce a new non-smooth variational model for the restoration of manifold-valued data which includes second order differences in the regularization term.
        While such models were successfully applied for real-valued images, we introduce the second order difference and the corresponding variational models for manifold data, which up to now only existed for cyclic data.
        The approach requires a combination of techniques from numerical analysis, convex optimization and differential geometry.
        First, we establish a suitable definition of absolute second order differences for signals and images with values in a manifold.
        Employing this definition, we introduce a variational denoising model based on first and second order differences in the manifold setup.
        In order to minimize the corresponding functional, we develop an algorithm using an inexact cyclic proximal point algorithm.
        We propose an efficient strategy for the computation of the corresponding proximal mappings in symmetric spaces utilizing the machinery of Jacobi fields.
        For the $n$-sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practice.
        We prove the convergence of the proposed exact and inexact variant of the cyclic proximal point algorithm in Hadamard spaces.
        These results which are of interest on its own include, e.g., the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices.
