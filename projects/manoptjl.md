`Manopt.jl` provides a framework for optimization on manifolds.
It follows the same ideology as [Manopt](https://manopt.org) and [pymanopt](https://pymanopt.org).
This toolbox aims to provide an easy access to optimization methods on manifolds
for [Julia](https://julialang.org), including example data and visualization methods.
