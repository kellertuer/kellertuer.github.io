In my PhD thesis {{cite Bergmann-2013-1}} we investigated translation
invariant spaces on anisotropic lattices, a corresponding fast Fourier
transform as well as periodic wavelets and a fast wavelet transform.
The corresponding wavelets are anisotropic and they are obtained by sampling
smooth functions in the Fourier domain and hence have certain localization properties in time. Especially a generalization of the de la Vallée Poussin mean to the anisotropic multivariate case is derived and their corresponding wavelets are derived.

Furthermore the software package was developed within [Mathematica](https://github.com/kellertuer/MPAWL/) and later transcribed to [Matlab](https://github.com/kellertuer/MPAWL-Matlab/) in order to be used within [the homogenization project](projects/homogenization/).
