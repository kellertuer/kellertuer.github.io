This project aims to investigate the discretization of elliptic partial
differential equations with periodic boundary conditions on anisotropic
spaces of translates. Of special interest are the influence of the
anisotropic sampling lattice, the choice of the translation invariant
space, convergence results and the investigation of periodic wavelets.
