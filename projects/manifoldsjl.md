summary = "[Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) implements a library of manifolds and provides combinators to construct new manifolds from these. Examples are the product manifold of two manifolds, the power manifold, the tangent bundle, and Lie groups. Using a trait-based system, any manifold may be augmented with additional geometric structure, including various metrics, without sacrificing efficiency."

Manifolds.jl provides a library of manifolds based on the [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html) interface to get an easy start to use manifolds within you project. It aims to provide a simple and efficient implementation of all necessary functions on manifolds.
