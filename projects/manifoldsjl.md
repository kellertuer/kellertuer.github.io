Manifolds.jl provides a library of manifolds based on the [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html) interface to get an easy start to use manifolds within you project. It aims to provide a simple and efficient implementation of all necessary functions on manifolds.
